        <br><br>
        <p>As a product designer, the design process is an integral part of creating successful<br>products. It begins with understanding the needs and wants of the customer, then<br>researching and brainstorming ideas to create a design that meets their needs. Once the<br>design has been created, it’s important to test and refine the product to ensure it meets the<br>customer’s expectations. This includes creating prototypes, conducting user testing,<br>creating wireframes and making necessary changes to the design.</p>
